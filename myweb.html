<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: small;"><strong>Why Blogging - Part 1?</strong></span><br /><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;">At a time when many brands are pivoting toward more video and social media marketing, is blogging still important? </span></strong><br /><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;">The answer is a resounding &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">My personal experience blogging not as a interest or passion.<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/10/10/21/47/laptop-2838921__340.jpg" width="269" height="160" style="float: right;" /><br />but looking as a source of income.</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">Guys, trust me when you connect something with money, then it becomes slowly as an interest.<br />it depends upon the person.</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">Thought, many things in the life, how people get sucessful.<br />some people said, its a passion its an interest, some said its hobby.</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">For Ex: A successful Football player becomes successful, when he start playing from childhood.<br />how does he becomes successful?</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">Not only his passion or interest or his wills, but its a support of all surroundings, an envoirnment he got in his childhood.<br />a career guidence he got from people, may be his family, parents, or any of his mentor.</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">Yes, there may be some exceptions born telented.</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">My worry is about the people, who have not received all this motivation, guidence, surroundings, envoirnment. e.t.c.</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">A person is expert in cricket, but he dont know this is international game, and he can go to the international level and make it as a career.<br />The reason is less of knowledge, he dont even know the thing its exist..</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">Let's come to the point....</p>
<p style="text-align: Left;">my things started not with passion, not an interest, but as an income source to survive my family.<br />So blogging..... Make it as a career.</p>
